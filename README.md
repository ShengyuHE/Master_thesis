Title: The Impact of Spectroscopic Systematics on the Measurement of Cosmological Parameters with Full-modeling Algorithm

link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/tctqrhxnwnmm#fcc023

## Requirements
Basic requirements
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib

We use the desilike pipeline
  - cosmoprimo
  - desilike
  - FOLPS (theory)
  - emcee (sampler)
  - getdist (corner plot)

## DATA
The analysis are based on the QUIJOTE simulation (https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

To add the spectroscopic systematics from to the box data, use 

To compute the pk, we use the pypower (https://github.com/cosmodesi/pypower)

## INSTALLATION
Most the scripts are based on jupyter Notebooks

Simply
```
git clone https://github.com/ShengyuHE/Master_thesis.git
```
