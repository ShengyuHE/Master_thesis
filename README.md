## Requirements
Basic requirements
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - getdist

We use the desilike pipeline
  - cosmoprimo
  - desilike
  - FOLPS (theory)
  - emcee (sampler)


## DATA

The analysis are based on the QUIJOTE simulation (https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
To add the spectroscopic systematics to the box data, use 
We use the pypower (https://github.com/cosmodesi/pypower) to calculate the pkl
